Group of 4 powerful Estonian women: Kristi, Eneli, Piret and Helina!

- Hello! I am Kristi, Orginally from small town Rapla, but now living about 15 years in Tallinn. I have two children and a Cat (very popular animal among this year participants). I am new to all things related to programming and learning has been difficult for me. So far I understand and enjoy more Python. 

- Hi, I'm Piret! Have been living in Tallinn for last 8 years, but born and lived before in Tartu. I'm working in aviation, and have a degree in electrical engineering, so really into technical stuff. Even though feeling like a noob in programming.

Hello! My name is Helina. Im originally from small village near Peipsi, lived in Tallinn for the past 20 years and spending all my free time from spring to autumn in Hiiumaa! I've a bachelor degree in socialwork, worked a bit in youthwork during my studies, but then followed my passion of creating beauty and now I have been a hairdresser for the past 15 years. And now im on this course, beacause Im ready for some new kind of beauty - creating beautiful codes. Its not been easy, rather challenging and struggeling, but Im trying do enjoy the journey!
