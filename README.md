Group of 4 powerful Estonian women!
Kristi, Eneli, Piret and Helina

Hello! I am Kristi, Orginally from small town Rapla, but now living about 15 years in Tallinn. I have two children and a Cat (very popular animal among this year participants). I am new to all things related to programming and learning has been difficult for me. So far I understand and enjoy more Python.
